# Predicting Bank Customer Churn - Capstone 1
-------- 
Hi!

My name is Momin Khan and this is my repo for my first capstone project: Predicting Customer Churn for a Wholesale Bank Organization.

I completed a number of projects as part of the Springboard Data Science Track.

For this project I implemented the first predictive model for my banking organization utilizing a Decision Tree model to classify bank customers leaving the bank or not in order to improve customer retention efforts. I attained ~77% AUC-ROC & demonstrated value of implementing machine learning in banking organization to expand customer retention efforts and techniques using machine learning initiatives.
