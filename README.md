# Predicting Bank Customer Churn - Capstone 1
-------- 
Hi!

My name is Momin Khan and this is my repo for my first capstone project: Predicting Customer Churn for a Wholesale Bank Organization.

I completed a number of projects as part of the Springboard Data Science Track.

For this project I implemented the first predictive model for my banking organization utilizing a Decision Tree model to classify bank customers leaving the bank or not in order to improve customer retention efforts. I attained ~77% AUC-ROC & demonstrated value of implementing machine learning in banking organization to expand customer retention efforts and techniques using machine learning initiatives. 

To find out more about this project, check out the attached presentation below!
